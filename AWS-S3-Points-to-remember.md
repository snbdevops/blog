Notes - 

->To automate the transition of S3 objects between their different tiers we can use 'S3 Lifecycle Rules'. 

->To get recommendations for S3 Lifecycle rules on the optimal number of days to move objects between different storage tiers we can use 'S3 Analytics'.

->To perform any update on each of the 1000s of objects stored in S3 bucket we can use 'S3 Batch operations'.

->The best approach to remove the unfinished parts stored in s3 bucket after the multipart upload is done, we can use an 'S3 Lifecycle policy' to automate old/unfinished part deletion.

->The best way to upload large dataset to S3 and ensure that the process is fast and avoid any problems with the Internet connection we can use 'S3 Multi-part upload & S3 Transfer Acceleration'.

->In a version enabled bucket if we want to delete old object versions to reduce cost, we can automate the deletion with the help of 'S3 Lifecycle Rules-Expiration Actions'

-> To generate reports on the replication and encryption status of your objects in the S3 bucket we can use 'S3 Inventory'.
