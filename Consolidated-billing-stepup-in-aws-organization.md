AWS Organizations allows you to set up consolidated billing to manage multiple AWS accounts under one umbrella, making it easier to track and optimize costs. Below mentioned is a step-by-step guide to set up **consolidated billing** using **AWS Organizations**:

### Steps to Set Up Consolidated Billing with AWS Organizations

#### 1. **Create an AWS Organizations Account**
   - Sign in to your AWS Management Console as the root user or an account with administrative privileges.
   - Go to the **AWS Organizations** console.
   - Create an organization by selecting "Create Organization" in the AWS Organizations dashboard.
     - Choose between two options:
       - **All Features**: Enables consolidated billing and advanced policy management features.
       - **Consolidated Billing Only**: Enables only billing without other management features.
   - Select **All Features** for complete access, including consolidated billing.

#### 2. **Designate a Management Account (Formerly Master Account)**
   - The first account that creates the organization becomes the **management account** (previously called the **master account**).
   - This account manages the billing and all settings for the organization.
   - **Note**: The management account is responsible for the charges incurred by all member accounts within the organization.

#### 3. **Invite or Create Member Accounts**
   - You can either create new AWS accounts or invite existing accounts to join your organization.
     - To **invite** an existing account:
       1. In the AWS Organizations console, go to the **Accounts** section.
       2. Click on **Invite Account**.
       3. Enter the email address or account ID of the AWS account you want to invite.
       4. The invited account owner will receive an email to accept the invitation.
     - To **create** a new account:
       1. In the **Accounts** section, click on **Add Account** > **Create Account**.
       2. Enter the details for the new account (email address, account name).
       3. AWS will automatically create the new member account under the organization.

#### 4. **Enable Consolidated Billing**
   - By default, when you create or invite accounts under AWS Organizations, consolidated billing is automatically enabled.
   - **Consolidated billing** combines the usage across all member accounts and provides a single bill to the management account.
   - All linked accounts continue to operate independently, but their billing data is aggregated.

#### 5. **View and Analyze Billing Data**
   - You can view consolidated billing details for all accounts in the management account.
   - Go to the **Billing and Cost Management** console in the management account:
     - View **Cost Explorer** to analyze and track usage and spending across all member accounts.
     - Use **Budgets** to set alerts based on spend thresholds across all accounts.
     - Set up **Cost Allocation Tags** to categorize and track costs associated with specific projects, departments, or resources.
   - AWS Organizations provides a **detailed breakdown of costs** for each member account, making it easy to monitor individual usage.

#### 6. **Enable and Use AWS Cost and Usage Reports (CUR)**
   - Enable **Cost and Usage Reports (CUR)** to get detailed billing data.
   - To set this up:
     1. Go to the **Billing Dashboard** in the management account.
     2. Under **Cost and Usage Reports**, click **Create Report**.
     3. Set up an S3 bucket to store the cost and usage data.
     4. Enable **Report** to track data at a detailed level, including individual account usage.
   - The CUR report will break down costs by account, service, region, and more, allowing deeper insights into spending.

#### 7. **Set Up Consolidated Savings Plans and Reserved Instances**
   - **Savings Plans** and **Reserved Instances (RIs)** can be shared across all accounts within an organization, maximizing cost savings.
     - Purchase **Savings Plans** or **RIs** in the management account, and the discount will automatically apply across all linked accounts, based on usage.
     - This helps to reduce the overall cost for compute resources (EC2, Fargate, Lambda).

#### 8. **Set Up Service Control Policies (Optional)**
   - Service Control Policies (SCPs) allow you to control the services and actions that member accounts can access.
   - To set up SCPs, go to the AWS Organizations console under the **Policies** section and create custom policies to manage access for the member accounts.
   - SCPs are particularly useful when managing compliance and security across multiple accounts.

#### 9. **Monitor and Manage Costs Across the Organization**
   - **AWS Cost Explorer**: Use Cost Explorer in the management account to visualize and understand the usage and cost patterns of all accounts in the organization.
   - **Budgets**: Set up budgets at the account or organization level to monitor spending and receive alerts when thresholds are exceeded.
   - **AWS Trusted Advisor**: Trusted Advisor can provide recommendations to optimize costs and security for all accounts in the organization.

### Key Benefits of Using Consolidated Billing
1. **One Bill for All Accounts**: All accounts in the organization get consolidated into a single bill.
2. **Shared Discounts**: Volume discounts, Reserved Instance discounts, and Savings Plans can be shared across multiple accounts.
3. **Cost Management**: Use AWS tools (Cost Explorer, Budgets) to track, allocate, and control costs.
4. **Account Autonomy**: Member accounts can still operate independently but are billed centrally.
5. **Simplified Financial Management**: Centralized billing simplifies accounting, tax, and financial reporting processes.

### Diagram Overview:
- **Management Account (Master Account)**: Handles billing and administration.
- **Member Accounts**: Contribute to consolidated billing and receive the benefits of shared discounts.

By setting up **AWS Organizations** for consolidated billing, we can streamline cost management, ensure that savings plans and volume discounts are shared, and simplify the financial oversight of multiple AWS accounts.
