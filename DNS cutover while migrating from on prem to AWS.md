how to perform DNS cutover while migrating from on prem to AWS?

Migrating from an on-premises infrastructure to AWS often involves updating DNS records to ensure that traffic is directed to the new AWS environment. This process, known as DNS cutover, needs to be carefully planned and executed to minimize downtime and ensure a smooth transition. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to perform a DNS cutover when migrating from on-premises to AWS:

### 1. **Pre-Migration Preparation**

1. **Plan the Migration**: 
   - Document your current DNS records and infrastructure.
   - Determine which DNS records need to be updated or created for the new AWS environment.

2. **Set Up the AWS Environment**:
   - Ensure that your AWS infrastructure is fully set up and tested, including instances, databases, load balancers, and any other services.
   - Make sure that your AWS environment is fully functional and ready to handle traffic.

3. **Update DNS Records**:
   - Create or modify DNS records in AWS Route 53 (or your chosen DNS provider) for the new AWS resources. Ensure these records match the structure and configuration of your current setup.

4. **Test the New Setup**:
   - Perform thorough testing of your AWS environment using temporary or staging DNS names to ensure everything works correctly.
   - Verify that applications and services are functioning as expected in AWS.

### 2. **DNS Cutover Process**

1. **Lower TTL Values**:
   - **TTL (Time-to-Live)**: Reduce the TTL values of your DNS records well in advance of the cutover. A lower TTL value (e.g., 300 seconds) helps ensure that DNS changes propagate quickly.
   - **Timing**: Change the TTL at least 24-48 hours before the cutover to ensure that the DNS cache on clients and resolvers expires quickly.

2. **Create or Update DNS Records**:
   - **Create New Records**: Add the necessary DNS records in your DNS provider (e.g., Route 53) that point to the new AWS resources.
   - **Update Existing Records**: Update the existing DNS records to point to the new AWS resources as needed.

3. **Monitor DNS Propagation**:
   - Use DNS propagation tools to monitor how the DNS changes are propagating across different regions.
   - Check for any discrepancies or issues and address them as needed.

4. **Perform the Cutover**:
   - **Switch Traffic**: When the DNS changes have propagated and you’re confident that the new AWS environment is stable, update the DNS records to point to the AWS environment.
   - **Monitor**: Continuously monitor the traffic and application performance to ensure that the cutover is successful and that there are no issues.

### 3. **Post-Cutover Activities**

1. **Verify Functionality**:
   - Confirm that all services and applications are functioning correctly in the AWS environment.
   - Check for any errors or performance issues and resolve them promptly.

2. **Monitor and Validate**:
   - Keep an eye on logs, application performance, and user feedback to ensure that everything is running smoothly.
   - Validate that all DNS changes have fully propagated and that there are no unexpected issues.

3. **Revert TTL Values**:
   - After a successful cutover, consider reverting the TTL values to their original settings if needed. Longer TTL values reduce DNS query load but slow down the propagation of future changes.

4. **Decommission On-Premises Resources**:
   - Once you are confident that everything is working correctly in AWS and no traffic is going to the old on-premises infrastructure, begin the process of decommissioning the old on-premises resources.

### Example Scenario

Suppose you have a website `www.example.com` hosted on-premises, and you are migrating to AWS. Here’s a simplified cutover plan:

1. **Before Cutover**:
   - Reduce the TTL for `www.example.com` to 300 seconds.
   - Set up an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) in AWS and point `www.example.com` to this ELB.

2. **Day of Cutover**:
   - Update the DNS record for `www.example.com` to point to the new AWS ELB endpoint.
   - Monitor DNS propagation and application performance.

3. **After Cutover**:
   - Check that traffic is flowing to AWS and that the website is functioning as expected.
   - Revert TTL settings if necessary and decommission the on-premises resources.

By carefully planning and executing the DNS cutover, you can minimize downtime and ensure a smooth transition from your on-premises infrastructure to AWS.
