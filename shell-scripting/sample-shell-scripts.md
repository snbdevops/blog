done
echo "Renamed all .txt files with timestamp."
```

### 5. **Monitor CPU Usage**
This script monitors CPU usage and sends an alert if it exceeds a threshold.
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Monitor CPU usage and alert if above threshold

THRESHOLD=80
CPU_USAGE=$(top -bn1 | grep "Cpu(s)" | awk '{print $2 + $4}')

if (( $(echo "$CPU_USAGE > $THRESHOLD" | bc -l) )); then
    echo "Warning: CPU usage is above $THRESHOLD%. Current usage: $CPU_USAGE%"
else
    echo "CPU usage is normal: $CPU_USAGE%"
fi
```

### 6. **Find and Delete Old Files**
This script finds and deletes files older than 30 days in a specified directory.
```bash

find /path/to/directory -type f -mtime +30 -exec rm {} \;
echo "Deleted files older than 30 days."
```

### 7. **Ping Multiple Servers**
This script pings a list of servers to check if they are reachable.
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Ping multiple servers

SERVERS=("server1.com" "server2.com" "8.8.8.8")

for server in "${SERVERS[@]}"; do
    if ping -c 1 $server &> /dev/null; then
        echo "$server is reachable"
    else
        echo "$server is not reachable"
    fi
done
```

### 8. **User Account Creation**
This script automates the creation of user accounts with a default home directory and password.

read -p "Enter username: " USERNAME
useradd -m $USERNAME
echo "$USERNAME:password123" | chpasswd
echo "User $USERNAME created with default password."
```

### 9. **File Permission Check**
This script checks the permissions of a given file and outputs whether it's writable, readable, or executable.
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check file permissions

FILE="/path/to/file"

if [ -r $FILE ]; then
    echo "$FILE is readable"
fi

if [ -w $FILE ]; then
    echo "$FILE is writable"
fi

if [ -x $FILE ]; then
    echo "$FILE is executable"
fi
```

### 10. **System Uptime Report**
This script generates a report of the system's uptime.
```bash
