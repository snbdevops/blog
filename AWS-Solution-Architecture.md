# AWS Solution Architect tips

### 1. **Understand AWS Core Services and Best Practices**

AWS Solutions Architect interviews often test your knowledge of the core AWS services and how well you can use them to architect scalable, secure, and efficient solutions. Understanding AWS's core services and best practices is critical to your success. Here, I'll elaborate more on these services and provide practical examples of how they fit into real-world architecture design.

#### **a. Compute (EC2, Lambda, ECS, EKS)**

AWS provides various compute services depending on the type of workloads you're running, the traffic patterns, and scalability needs.

- **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: Provides resizable virtual servers (instances). You need to understand the different instance types, pricing models (On-Demand, Reserved, Spot Instances), and Auto Scaling.

**Example**:
- For a high-traffic website, you could design an architecture where EC2 instances are launched in an Auto Scaling group behind an Elastic Load Balancer. This ensures that the number of instances scales up and down based on traffic load, optimizing both performance and cost.

- **Lambda**: AWS's serverless compute service. Lambda runs code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying infrastructure. It's cost-effective for workloads that don’t require always-on servers.

**Example**:
- If you are building a microservice architecture, you might use Lambda to handle specific API requests triggered through API Gateway. For example, Lambda can be used to trigger an image processing task when a new image is uploaded to an S3 bucket.

- **ECS (Elastic Container Service)** and **EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**: For containerized applications, ECS and EKS provide the infrastructure needed to run Docker containers. ECS is AWS-managed, while EKS provides a managed Kubernetes environment.

**Example**:
- In an environment where applications are containerized, you might run microservices using ECS Fargate, a serverless compute engine for containers. If you prefer Kubernetes, EKS would be the choice for deploying and managing containerized applications at scale.

**Best Practices**:
- **Right-Sizing Instances**: When using EC2, make sure you're choosing the right instance type and size for the workload. Use EC2 Auto Scaling to optimize cost by scaling resources up and down.
- **Event-Driven Design**: Use Lambda for event-driven architectures, where you only pay for the compute resources when your code is running.

#### **b. Storage (S3, EBS, EFS, Glacier)**

AWS provides a range of storage services to meet different needs for performance, cost, and durability.

- **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Object storage ideal for storing and retrieving any amount of data at scale. S3 can be used for website hosting, backup, archival, and big data analytics.

**Example**:
- Imagine an e-commerce application where product images, videos, and customer documents are stored in S3. You can use S3 versioning and S3 lifecycle policies to manage the lifecycle of objects by moving them to cheaper storage tiers such as **S3 Glacier** for archival after a certain period.

- **EBS (Elastic Block Store)**: Block storage for EC2 instances. It’s suitable for databases, file systems, or any application that requires frequent reads and writes with low latency.

**Example**:
- You could use EBS as the persistent storage for an EC2 instance running a MySQL database. You might opt for EBS Provisioned IOPS (SSD) to provide the low-latency performance that your database demands.

- **EFS (Elastic File System)**: A scalable file system that can be mounted by multiple EC2 instances simultaneously. Ideal for workloads that need shared storage.

**Example**:
- In a web application where multiple EC2 instances need to access the same set of files (e.g., application configurations, shared libraries), you could use EFS to allow all EC2 instances to read from and write to the same file system.

**Best Practices**:
- **Cost Optimization**: Use **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** to automatically move objects between different storage classes based on changing access patterns. This ensures cost efficiency.
- **Data Durability and Availability**: Store critical data in S3, which offers 99.999999999% (11 9s) durability. Enable cross-region replication for high availability and disaster recovery.

#### **c. Databases (RDS, DynamoDB, Aurora, Redshift)**

Understanding when to use relational vs. NoSQL databases is critical for designing performant and scalable architectures.

- **RDS (Relational Database Service)**: Provides fully managed relational databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and SQL Server. RDS handles backups, patching, and scaling, allowing you to focus on your application.

**Example**:
- For a social media application, where structured data like user profiles and posts are stored, RDS MySQL or PostgreSQL would be a good choice. You can enable **Multi-AZ deployments** to ensure high availability and automatic failover in case of an instance failure.

- **DynamoDB**: AWS’s managed NoSQL database for key-value and document-based data. It’s ideal for applications that need low-latency access to large amounts of data.

**Example**:
- For an online gaming application that tracks player scores and achievements in real-time, DynamoDB would be a great choice because it can handle millions of requests per second with low latency.

- **Aurora**: A highly performant, MySQL- and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database. Aurora offers five times the throughput of standard MySQL and three times that of PostgreSQL.

**Example**:
- If you’re building an online banking system that requires strong performance and durability, Aurora could be used as the backend database. Aurora’s **Global Database** feature can be used for disaster recovery and to replicate data across multiple AWS regions with low latency.

- **Redshift**: A fully managed data warehouse service for big data analytics. Redshift can process large-scale data analytics workloads and integrate with other AWS services like S3 and Glue.

**Example**:
- For a company that needs to run complex queries on large datasets (e.g., sales and customer data), Redshift would be the service of choice. You could ingest data from S3, run analytics queries, and use Redshift Spectrum to directly query data stored in S3 without loading it into Redshift.

**Best Practices**:
- **Horizontal Scalability**: For NoSQL databases like DynamoDB, use partition keys effectively to distribute data across partitions and avoid performance bottlenecks.
- **High Availability**: Use RDS with **Multi-AZ** and DynamoDB with **Global Tables** for automatic failover and replication across regions.

#### **d. Networking and Content Delivery (VPC, Route 53, CloudFront, Direct Connect)**

AWS provides flexible networking capabilities, including routing, load balancing, DNS, and VPN.

- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: VPC allows you to create isolated networks within AWS, complete with subnets, route tables, and gateways. Understanding VPC fundamentals (public/private subnets, NAT Gateways, etc.) is essential.

**Example**:
- For a three-tier web application, you would design a VPC with **public subnets** for the web servers (front-end) and **private subnets** for the application servers and databases (back-end). A **NAT Gateway** would be used to allow outbound internet access for instances in the private subnets.

- **Route 53**: AWS's scalable DNS and domain name registration service. Route 53 can be used for domain registration, routing traffic based on geolocation, and even for health checks and failover routing.

**Example**:
- Use Route 53’s **geolocation routing policy** to route traffic from European users to an AWS region in Europe and U.S. traffic to an AWS region in the United States to reduce latency and comply with data residency requirements.

- **CloudFront**: A Content Delivery Network (CDN) for delivering web content and other assets to users worldwide with low latency. It caches content at edge locations around the globe.

**Example**:
- A media company that needs to serve video-on-demand to users globally could use CloudFront to cache video files in edge locations, significantly improving performance for end users.

- **Direct Connect**: Provides a dedicated network connection between on-premises environments and AWS, bypassing the public internet for better security and performance.

**Example**:
- An enterprise that runs a hybrid cloud environment might use AWS Direct Connect to create a secure, low-latency connection between its on-premises data center and AWS, ensuring faster and more reliable data transfer.

**Best Practices**:
- **Secure Networking**: Use security groups and network ACLs to control traffic to your instances. Use VPC **peering** and **Transit Gateway** to enable secure and efficient communication between multiple VPCs.
- **Content Delivery Optimization**: Use CloudFront to cache dynamic and static content globally for better performance. Integrate it with AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) to protect against common web threats.

#### **e. Security (IAM, KMS, Shield, WAF)**

Security is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer, and it's crucial to implement robust security measures.

- **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**: IAM allows you to manage access to AWS resources. You can create users, groups, and roles and define permissions using policies.

**Example**:
- You could create an IAM role that grants an EC2 instance access to read data from an S3 bucket without exposing credentials in the instance. By using **IAM roles** instead of hardcoded credentials, you enhance security and minimize the attack surface.

- **KMS (Key Management Service)**: KMS provides a secure way to create and control encryption keys used to encrypt data across AWS services (S3, EBS, RDS, etc.).

**Example**:
- If you're handling sensitive customer data in S3, you can use **SSE-KMS** (Server-Side Encryption with KMS) to ensure that all data is encrypted with a customer-managed key. 

- **WAF (Web Application Firewall)**: WAF protects web applications from common exploits such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Example**:
- In a serverless web application running behind an **API Gateway**, you can deploy AWS WAF to filter out malicious traffic and prevent web application attacks.

- **AWS Shield**: A managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection service. It’s integrated with CloudFront and Route 53.

**Example**:
- For a high-profile e-commerce application, you can enable **AWS Shield Advanced** to protect against DDoS attacks, ensuring your application remains available during large-scale attacks.

**Best Practices**:
- **Least Privilege Principle**: Always follow the principle of least privilege by granting users and services only the permissions they need.
- **Encryption**: Use encryption at rest (e.g., EBS, S3 with KMS) and encryption in transit (e.g., HTTPS, TLS) to protect sensitive data.

### 6. IAM

#### 1. **Cross-Account Access Management**

**Scenario**: You manage multiple AWS accounts for different departments in your organization, and you need to allow a DevOps team in one account to access specific S3 buckets in another account. How would you securely set up cross-account access?

**Follow-Up Questions**:
- How would you use IAM roles to allow access without sharing credentials across accounts?
- Can you explain the security implications of this setup?
- What best practices would you implement to ensure least privilege is maintained?

**Expected Answer**:
- You should use **IAM roles with cross-account trust policies**. Create a role in the account that owns the S3 bucket, and specify a trust policy that allows the DevOps team's AWS account to assume this role.
- In the trusting account (where the S3 bucket exists), update the bucket policy to allow access from the IAM role in the other account.
- To ensure security, enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for the role assumption, and apply **fine-grained permissions** to ensure that the DevOps team can only access the specific resources needed.

---

#### 2. **Securing Temporary Credentials Using AssumeRole**

**Scenario**: You have a microservices architecture where multiple services run on EC2 instances, and each service needs temporary access to specific AWS resources such as DynamoDB, S3, and Lambda. How would you design the IAM architecture to ensure each service has the appropriate level of access?

**Follow-Up Questions**:
- How would you avoid hardcoding credentials?
- How do you manage access for services that require temporary permissions?
- How would you audit and monitor the access granted?

**Expected Answer**:
- You should configure each EC2 instance with an **IAM role** that has the minimum required permissions for each service. The services can then use the **AWS Security Token Service (STS)** to assume roles and get temporary credentials dynamically.
- Use **instance profiles** to assign roles to EC2 instances, ensuring that no hardcoded credentials are required.
- Implement **CloudWatch Logs** and **AWS CloudTrail** to track the AssumeRole API calls, and audit any unusual access patterns.

---

#### 3. **Managing Privileged User Access**

**Scenario**: You have several administrators who require access to sensitive resources, such as production databases and key management service (KMS) keys. How would you manage and secure their access in a multi-account AWS environment?

**Follow-Up Questions**:
- How would you prevent accidental or malicious misuse of privileges?
- What role does MFA play in securing access?
- How would you audit administrator actions?

**Expected Answer**:
- For privileged users, create a **separate IAM role with elevated permissions** that can only be assumed when necessary. Use **IAM policies** to limit access to the critical resources such as RDS databases and KMS keys.
- Require **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** when assuming this elevated role, enforcing an additional layer of security.
- Enable **CloudTrail** across all AWS accounts to log and audit actions taken by the administrators. Set up **CloudWatch Alarms** for unusual activities, such as IAM changes or access to sensitive resources.

---

#### 4. **IAM Permissions Boundary**

**Scenario**: You have a development team that is responsible for deploying infrastructure using Terraform. However, you want to enforce restrictions on what resources they can create or manage in AWS without changing their day-to-day workflows. How would you achieve this?

**Follow-Up Questions**:
- How does a permissions boundary differ from standard IAM policies?
- How would you enforce resource creation limits while still allowing flexibility for the development team?
- What are the potential security risks of not implementing this?

**Expected Answer**:
- You would apply an **IAM permissions boundary** to restrict the actions that the development team can perform. Permissions boundaries allow you to define the maximum permissions that IAM entities (such as users or roles) can have.
- The development team can still use their existing roles and permissions to deploy resources, but the boundary ensures that they cannot create resources outside of specific limits (e.g., they can only launch EC2 instances of certain types or in specific regions).
- Without permissions boundaries, there’s a risk of the team inadvertently provisioning resources that violate organizational compliance, overspend on services, or compromise security.

### 7. While designing an solution what all things to be taken in consideration from security and compliance perspective so that the environment becomes highly complient and secured?

When designing a solution from a **security** and **compliance** perspective, especially in AWS environments, there are several critical factors to ensure that the environment is not only secure but also compliant with relevant regulations and industry standards. Here is a comprehensive list of considerations to keep in mind:

#### **1. Identity and Access Management (IAM)**

**Key Considerations**:
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant users and systems the minimum permissions required to perform their tasks. Avoid broad policies like `AdministratorAccess` unless absolutely necessary.
  - Example: Use IAM policies that restrict access to only specific S3 buckets, EC2 instances, or DynamoDB tables.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement roles instead of individual user-based permissions. Use IAM roles for cross-account access and within services like EC2 and Lambda.
  - Example: Assign an IAM role with read-only access to a team that handles auditing and logging.
- **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)**: Enforce MFA for all privileged and sensitive actions, especially for users accessing the management console or assuming roles with elevated permissions.
  - Example: Require MFA to assume an IAM role for deploying production changes.

**Security Best Practices**:
- Rotate IAM access keys regularly and audit their usage.
- Use AWS Organizations and Service Control Policies (SCPs) to enforce consistent security policies across multiple accounts.
- Implement **IAM Permission Boundaries** to limit the maximum permissions that users and roles can have.

#### **2. Network Security**

**Key Considerations**:
- **VPC Design**: Use AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to segment your network. Design multiple subnets (public, private, and isolated) to segregate application tiers and enforce security boundaries.
  - Example: Deploy your database in private subnets and your web servers in public subnets with proper security group configurations.
- **Security Groups and NACLs**: Use Security Groups (SG) and Network ACLs (NACLs) to control inbound and outbound traffic. Follow a deny-all approach and explicitly allow only necessary traffic.
  - Example: Create security groups that only allow traffic to port 443 (HTTPS) from specific IP ranges.
- **VPC Peering/Transit Gateway**: Use secure VPC peering or AWS Transit Gateway for communication between VPCs. Avoid exposing private networks over public internet connections.
  - Example: Use Transit Gateway to manage connectivity between production and staging environments across different VPCs.

**Security Best Practices**:
- Enable **VPC Flow Logs** to capture network traffic information for monitoring and troubleshooting.
- Use **AWS Network Firewall** or third-party firewalls to filter traffic and enforce deep packet inspection.
- Consider **AWS Shield** and **AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)** to protect against DDoS attacks and application-layer threats.

#### **3. Data Encryption**

**Key Considerations**:
- **Encryption at Rest**: Ensure all data at rest is encrypted using services like **AWS KMS (Key Management Service)** or **S3 default encryption**.
  - Example: Enable server-side encryption (SSE) for all S3 buckets and use KMS keys to manage encryption for RDS databases.
- **Encryption in Transit**: Use SSL/TLS for all communications. Enforce HTTPS and secure communication between services (e.g., using `aws:SecureTransport` conditions in IAM policies).
  - Example: Set up SSL certificates using **AWS ACM (Certificate Manager)** for securing web applications hosted on **ELB** or **API Gateway**.
- **Key Management**: Use **AWS KMS** to centrally manage and audit encryption keys. Implement key rotation policies to maintain key hygiene.
  - Example: Rotate KMS keys regularly and audit key usage through **CloudTrail** logs.

**Security Best Practices**:
- Enable **S3 Block Public Access** and use S3 bucket policies to restrict access to encrypted objects only.
- Ensure that RDS instances use **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)** or KMS-managed encryption.
- Consider client-side encryption for highly sensitive data before uploading to S3.

#### **4. Monitoring and Logging**

**Key Considerations**:
- **CloudTrail**: Enable **AWS CloudTrail** across all accounts and regions to log API activity. Use **CloudWatch** to monitor and alert on key events, such as changes to IAM policies, security groups, and resource deletions.
  - Example: Set up CloudTrail to track all changes to IAM roles, VPC security groups, and EC2 instance launches.
- **CloudWatch and Config**: Use **CloudWatch Logs** for monitoring and alerting, and **AWS Config** for continuously evaluating compliance with configuration policies.
  - Example: Set up AWS Config rules to ensure that S3 buckets are not publicly accessible and that EC2 instances have encryption enabled.
- **GuardDuty**: Enable **Amazon GuardDuty** for threat detection and continuous monitoring of malicious activity and unauthorized behavior.
  - Example: Use GuardDuty to detect potential compromise of IAM credentials or anomalous activity in your VPC traffic.

**Security Best Practices**:
- Use **AWS Security Hub** to aggregate security findings and ensure compliance with frameworks like **CIS Benchmarks**, **NIST**, or **ISO 27001**.
- Set up **VPC Flow Logs** and **ELB Logs** for deeper insight into network traffic and load balancer activity.
- Enable **CloudWatch Alarms** for critical security incidents such as root account access or unencrypted data uploads to S3.

#### **5. Compliance and Auditing**

**Key Considerations**:
- **Compliance Frameworks**: Understand the compliance frameworks (e.g., **PCI-DSS**, **HIPAA**, **GDPR**, **SOC 2**) that apply to your business. Ensure that your architecture aligns with the specific regulatory requirements.
  - Example: Implement **AWS Artifact** to access and manage AWS compliance documentation and certifications.
- **Logging and Auditing**: Ensure that logs are centrally stored and immutable. Use **AWS CloudWatch Logs** or a third-party solution like **Splunk** or **ELK Stack** to aggregate logs and ensure they meet compliance requirements.
  - Example: Configure CloudWatch Logs retention policies to comply with the regulatory requirement of keeping audit logs for a specific duration (e.g., 7 years for certain healthcare records).
- **Data Residency and Sovereignty**: For compliance with laws like GDPR, ensure that personal data stays within specific regions. Use **AWS Regions** that comply with local regulations on data storage and transfer.
  - Example: Store data of EU citizens only in AWS European regions and enable **Amazon Macie** to identify and protect sensitive data.

**Security Best Practices**:
- Use **AWS Config** to ensure continuous compliance with internal security and operational standards.
- Enable **AWS Audit Manager** to continuously assess, audit, and report on your environment's compliance posture.
- Conduct regular **penetration testing** and vulnerability assessments to ensure your architecture meets security standards.

#### **6. Incident Response and Disaster Recovery**

**Key Considerations**:
- **Incident Response Planning**: Create a formal incident response plan (IRP). Integrate security tools like **GuardDuty**, **AWS Macie**, and **AWS Inspector** to detect and respond to threats.
  - Example: Set up automatic remediation actions using **AWS Systems Manager Automation** to isolate compromised EC2 instances.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Implement **regular backups** for critical data. Use services like **AWS Backup** for automated backup and restore processes for resources like RDS, S3, and DynamoDB.
  - Example: Enable point-in-time recovery for DynamoDB tables and take regular snapshots of EBS volumes.
- **DR Strategy**: Define your **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)** and **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)** and ensure that your disaster recovery (DR) architecture meets these goals.
  - Example: Use **AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery** for replicating and recovering workloads to a secondary region in case of a disaster.

**Security Best Practices**:
- Enable **AWS Multi-AZ** deployments for databases to ensure high availability.
- Implement regular **failover drills** and test your disaster recovery processes to ensure they work as expected.
- Use **AWS Fault Injection Simulator (FIS)** to inject chaos and test your system's resilience under stress.

---

#### **7. Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**

**Key Considerations**:
- **Secure Code Practices**: Ensure that all code deployed in the cloud follows secure coding practices. Use **static code analysis** and **vulnerability scanning** tools like **AWS CodeGuru** or **third-party tools** (e.g., SonarQube, Snyk) integrated into your CI/CD pipeline.
  - Example: Use **CodePipeline** with CodeGuru Reviewer to catch any security issues in code before production.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security**: Apply security checks to Terraform, CloudFormation, or CDK templates. Use tools like **Checkov** or **Terraform Sentinel** to enforce policies such as ensuring encryption and restricted network access.
  - Example: Use AWS Config rules to validate that CloudFormation templates deploy resources that are compliant with encryption and IAM best practices.
  
**Security Best Practices**:

# AWS Migration Services

### VMWare(vCenter) Instance Migration - 	

There is a plugin which helps us to achieve this. When we right click on that we see options of 'Migrate to EC2'. Once we click that we are asked few info like OS, Region, Env, Subnet, Instance type, SG, etc. Click on ok after that. It will be migrated to EC2.

Note - AWS Mgmt Portal for vCenter allows customer to manage the AWS resources from their VMWare vCenter dashboard itself.

### AWS Server Migration Service(SMS)

-AWS SMS is an agentless service which makes it easier and faster for you to migrate thousands of on-premises workloads to AWS.

-Supported platforms: vSphere and Hyper-V.

-Steps involved.

1. Scheduled: Schedule migration job

2. Uploading:
        a) Take a snapshot, b) Export VM to OVF template, c) upload VMDK to the S3 bucket, d) Clean the snapshot.

4. Converting:
	a)Convert VMDK file to an AWS EBS snapshot, b) Delete the VMDK file in the S3 bucket.

5. Create an AMI

### Application Discovery Service

-AWS Application Discovery Service helps enterprise customer plan migration projects by gathering information about their on-prem data centers.

-For enterprises which has 100s to 1000s of servers on-prem, we get to know network dependency(it shows in a diagrammatic representation), right instance types for them can be, etc.

-It supports both agentless discovery and agent-based discovery.

-Agentless service needs installation of the discovery connector in VMware vCenter. 

-Agent-based service requires agent to be installed in OS.[with this we get network and dependencies diagrammatic representation].

### AWS DMS

-AWS DMS is a cloud service that makes it possible to migrate relational db, data warehouses, NoSQL db, and other types of data stores.

-We can use AWS DMS to migrate our data into the AWS cloud or between combinations of cloud and on-prem. setups.

			      AWS DMS
			      |		             {Replication Instance}	            |
		  Source DB --|-> Source Endpoint ---> [Replication task] ---> Tgt Endpt. --|-> Tgt DB
			      |						                    |

-At a basic level, AWS DMS is a server in the AWS Cloud that runs replication software. So we have the DMS server, it takes the data from on premise and it copies it to a specific target. And this is the reason why you create a source and a target connection to tell the DMS where to extract from and load to. So this specific DMS should be able to connect to both the database in the on premise as well as the target database.

-So as part of demo, we will migrate a employee database from the digital ocean env. to the EC two instance. So let's go ahead and look into the process at a very high level steps overview.

-In DMS console, under Migrate Data > Click on DB migration task> fillup the create db migration task form as below - 
Name: migration task.
	
Replication Instance: Choose the created replication instance.[create this first if not created]

Source DB Endpoint:[create this first if not created][It is connected to source DB]

Target DB Endpoint:[create this first if not created][It is connected to source DB]

Selection rules:
   Source Name: employees

keep rest as per requirement and once filled click on 'create task'. 

-DMS traditionally moves smaller relational workloads(<10 TB).

-AWS DMS supports ongoing replication to keep the tgt in sync with the source; 

### AWS Schema Conversion Tool

-Data migration is NOT just about taking backup of src db and upload in to tgt. In many cases we also have to change the overall schema of the db. Ex: lets say of src db is Oracle and we need to move it to RDS Postgre, we need to 1st do schema conversion with help of AWS Schema Conversion Tool(SCT) and then proceed with the migration including the converted schemas.

-Schema conversion tools: AWS offers 2 schema conversion solutions to make heterogenous db migrations predictable, fast, secure, and simple.
   1. DMS Schema Conversion(Fully Managed).
   2. AWS SCT software.(We need to go and download and install the SCT in our systems and use it to convert the schemas.)

-AWS SCT is primarily used to migrate large data warehouse workloads.

-SCT does not support replication.

-SCT can also run in offline mode.

### DMS Migration Types

-Migrate existing data - perform a one-time migration from source endpt to the tgt endpt.

-Migrate existing data & replicate ongoing changes - perform a one-time migration from source endpt to the tgt endpt, and then continue replicating data changes from the source to the tgt.

-Replicate data changes only - dont perform a one-time migration, but continue to replicate data changes from the source to tgt.

-Imp note:
1. Most engines require some additional configuration to make it possible for the capture process to consume the change data in a meaningful way, without data loss. Ex: Oracle requires the addition of supplemental logging, and MySQL requires row-level binary logging(bin logging).

2. We can also create a task that captures ongoing changes after we complete our initial(full-load) migration to a supported target data store. This process is called ongoing replication or change data capture(CDC).

### AWS Outposts
AWS Outposts is a fully managed service that offers the same AWS infra, AWS service, APIs and tools to virtually any datacenter, co-location space, or on-premises facility.

### AWS DataSync

-AWS Datasync is an online data transfer service that simplifies, automates, and accelerates moving data between storage systems and services.

-Datasync provides end-to-end security, including encryption, integrity validation to help ensure that your data arrives securely, intact and ready to use.

-Transferring the data between the on premise and a aws, there is a requirement of data sync agent.
