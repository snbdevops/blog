Here are some essential Jenkins troubleshooting tips to help you resolve common issues efficiently:

---

### 1. **Jenkins is slow or unresponsive**
   - **Cause**: High load on Jenkins master due to too many jobs running or resource exhaustion.
   - **Troubleshooting**:
     1. **Check resource usage**: Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage on the Jenkins server. Use tools like `top`, `htop`, or Jenkins' built-in monitoring plugins.
     2. **Optimize job execution**: Move heavy build jobs to Jenkins agents (slaves) rather than running them on the master.
     3. **Upgrade hardware**: Consider increasing the server's resources (CPU/RAM), or moving to a more powerful instance.
     4. **Review logs**: Check logs (`/var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log`) for errors or resource bottlenecks.
     5. **Limit concurrent builds**: Restrict the number of builds running concurrently in job configuration (`# of executors`).

---

### 2. **Jenkins is not triggering builds from a Git repository**
   - **Cause**: Issues with webhooks, credentials, or branch configuration.
   - **Troubleshooting**:
     1. **Verify webhook setup**: Ensure the Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) is properly configured to send webhooks to Jenkins.
     2. **Check credentials**: Ensure Jenkins has the correct credentials for accessing the Git repository. Test the connection manually using the `git ls-remote` command.
     3. **SCM polling**: If relying on SCM polling instead of webhooks, verify the `pollSCM` schedule is correctly configured in the job.
     4. **Branch specification**: Ensure the branch configuration (e.g., `refs/heads/*` or specific branch names) is set correctly in the job.

---

### 3. **Builds are failing due to "out of disk space" error**
   - **Cause**: Jenkins workspaces, artifacts, and logs are using too much disk space.
   - **Troubleshooting**:
     1. **Clean up workspaces**: Automatically clean up workspaces after builds by enabling **"Discard old builds"** in job configuration.
     2. **Reduce build retention**: Set the job to keep fewer builds or artifacts by using the `buildDiscarder` option:
        ```groovy
        options {
            buildDiscarder(logRotator(numToKeepStr: '10'))
        }
        ```
     3. **Delete old workspaces**: Use the **Workspace Cleanup Plugin** to delete old, unused workspaces.
     4. **Increase disk space**: Add more disk space to the Jenkins server if necessary.

---

### 4. **Jenkins is unable to connect to a build agent (slave)**
   - **Cause**: Network or credential issues between the Jenkins master and agent.
   - **Troubleshooting**:
     1. **Check agent logs**: Review the agent logs (e.g., `/var/log/jenkins/slave.log`) to identify connection errors.
     2. **Firewall or network issues**: Ensure that the agent can communicate with the master over the correct port (default: 50000). Check firewall and security group rules.
     3. **Credential issues**: Ensure that the Jenkins master has the correct credentials to authenticate with the agent (SSH keys, user credentials).
     4. **Agent configuration**: Reconfigure the agent in Jenkins and ensure that the launch method (e.g., SSH, JNLP) is correctly set up.

---

### 5. **Jenkins build hangs or fails due to a timeout**
   - **Cause**: Long-running processes or external systems causing delays.
   - **Troubleshooting**:
     1. **Timeout settings**: Set timeouts for specific build steps or stages in your Jenkinsfile:
        ```groovy
        timeout(time: 30, unit: 'MINUTES') {
            sh 'long-running-task.sh'
        }
        ```
     2. **Retry mechanism**: Use a `retry` block to automatically retry steps that fail due to temporary issues:
        ```groovy
        retry(3) {
            sh 'unstable-command.sh'
        }
        ```
     3. **Check external dependencies**: Ensure that external systems (e.g., APIs, databases) are responsive, and the Jenkins build is not waiting indefinitely for a response.

---

### 6. **Jenkins keeps restarting unexpectedly**
   - **Cause**: Out of memory (OOM), misconfiguration, or plugin issues.
   - **Troubleshooting**:
     1. **Check Jenkins logs**: Review logs (`/var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log`) for any OOM or crash-related entries.
     2. **Increase JVM memory**: Increase the memory allocated to Jenkins by modifying `JAVA_OPTS` (e.g., `-Xmx4G` for 4GB heap size).
     3. **Disable faulty plugins**: If the issue started after a plugin update, disable or downgrade the problematic plugin.
     4. **System resource check**: Ensure the server is not running out of CPU, memory, or disk resources.
     5. **OS-level logs**: Review the system logs (`/var/log/syslog` or `dmesg`) for any OS-related crashes or issues.

---

### 7. **Jobs are queued but not executed**
   - **Cause**: No available executors or misconfigured job limits.
   - **Troubleshooting**:
     1. **Check executors**: Ensure there are enough executors available in Jenkins. Go to **Manage Jenkins** -> **Nodes** to review the number of executors assigned to each agent.
     2. **Restrict job concurrency**: Check if the job is restricted to run only one build at a time and if a build is already running.
     3. **Check agent status**: Ensure that the agents are online and connected to Jenkins. If any agents are offline, troubleshoot the connection issues.

---

### 8. **Jenkins unable to access credentials**
   - **Cause**: Misconfiguration in Jenkins credentials management.
   - **Troubleshooting**:
     1. **Verify credential IDs**: Ensure that the correct credential ID is used in the Jenkinsfile or job configuration.
     2. **Credential permissions**: Verify that Jenkins has the correct permissions to use the specified credentials.
     3. **Credential scope**: Ensure the credentials are set to the correct scope (e.g., Global or System).
     4. **Recreate credentials**: If credentials are corrupted, recreate the credential entry in Jenkins.

---

### 9. **Jenkins is unable to archive artifacts**
   - **Cause**: Path issues or insufficient permissions.
   - **Troubleshooting**:
     1. **Artifact path**: Ensure that the artifact path in the job configuration is correct (e.g., `target/*.jar`).
     2. **Permissions**: Verify that Jenkins has sufficient permissions to access the directory where artifacts are stored.
     3. **Check disk space**: Ensure that there is enough disk space available for Jenkins to store the artifacts.

---

### 10. **Jenkins is not sending email notifications**
   - **Cause**: Email notification plugin misconfiguration or SMTP issues.
   - **Troubleshooting**:
     1. **Email Plugin Configuration**: Go to **Manage Jenkins** -> **Configure System** and check the email notification settings (SMTP server, port, credentials).
     2. **Test SMTP settings**: Use the **Test configuration by sending test e-mail** button to verify the SMTP configuration.
     3. **Jenkinsfile configuration**: Ensure that email notifications are correctly configured in your Jenkinsfile using `emailext`:
        ```groovy
        post {
            failure {
                emailext to: 'team@example.com', subject: 'Build Failed', body: 'The build has failed'
            }
        }
        ```

---

### 11. **Jenkins unable to clone Git repository**
   - **Cause**: Incorrect repository URL, authentication issues, or network problems.
   - **Troubleshooting**:

     3. **Test manually**: Try cloning the repository manually from the Jenkins server or agent to ensure network and credentials are set up correctly:
        ```bash
        git clone git@github.com:user/repository.git
        ```
     4. **Firewall or proxy**: If cloning over HTTPS, ensure there are no firewall or proxy issues blocking access to the repository.

---

### 12. **Jenkins pipeline stages are not being executed**
   - **Cause**: Pipeline syntax errors or conditions preventing stages from running.
   - **Troubleshooting**:
     1. **Check syntax**: Ensure the `Jenkinsfile` has no syntax errors. You can validate it using Jenkins' **Pipeline Syntax** tool.
     2. **Conditionals**: Verify that the conditions for stage execution (e.g., `when {}` or `if` statements) are properly configured and returning true when expected.
     3. **Logs and output**: Review the pipeline logs for clues as to why stages are skipped.
     4. **Scripted vs Declarative pipeline**: Ensure that the pipeline syntax matches the correct pipeline type (declarative vs scripted).

---

### 13. **Jenkins Blue Ocean UI not loading**
   - **Cause**: Plugin issues or memory-related problems.
   - **Troubleshooting**:
     1. **Browser cache**: Clear the browser cache or try opening Blue Ocean in an incognito/private window.
     2. **Disable/enable Blue Ocean Plugin**: If the issue persists, disable and re-enable the Blue Ocean Plugin via **Manage Jenkins** -> **Manage Plugins**.
     3. **Check for plugin conflicts**: Ensure that all plugins, especially those related to Blue Ocean, are up to date.
     4. **Increase JVM memory**: Allocate more memory to Jenkins (`-Xmx` option) if memory consumption is causing UI load problems.

---

### 14. **Jenkins job stuck in the queue**
   - **Cause**: Lack of available executors, resources, or misconfigured job.
   - **Troubleshooting**:

     2. **Job resource limits**: Check if the job is waiting for resources like workspace or agent availability.
     3. **Blocked jobs**: Investigate if another job is blocking this one due to resource or lock contention.
     4. **Job restrictions**: Ensure that the job is not configured to only run on specific agents or labels that are offline or have no available executors.

---

### 15. **Jenkins build fails due to “Permission Denied” errors**
   - **Cause**: File or directory permissions not set correctly on the server or agent.
   - **Troubleshooting**:
     1. **Check permissions**: Ensure that the Jenkins user has read/write permissions for the build directory and any external files or directories being accessed.
     2. **Adjust ownership**: Change ownership of directories to the Jenkins user if required:
        ```bash
        sudo chown -R jenkins:jenkins /path/to/build/directory
        ```
     3. **Check file modes**: If scripts are failing, make sure they have the executable bit set:
        ```bash
        chmod +x script.sh
        ```

---

### 16. **Jenkins job fails due to missing dependencies**
   - **Cause**: Required software or tools are not installed on the agent.
   - **Troubleshooting**:
     1. **Check installed dependencies**: Ensure all necessary dependencies (e.g., Java, Maven, Docker, etc.) are installed on the Jenkins agent or master.
     2. **Install missing dependencies**: Install the required packages using the appropriate package manager (`apt`, `yum`, `brew`, etc.).
     3. **Agent-specific configurations**: If the job runs on different agents, ensure the required dependencies are available on all agents.
     4. **PATH issues**: Ensure the binaries are available in the agent’s `PATH` environment variable.

---

### 17. **Build triggers are not working (e.g., scheduled builds, SCM polling)**
   - **Cause**: Misconfigured triggers or issues with cron/polling intervals.
   - **Troubleshooting**:
     1. **Check cron syntax**: Ensure that the cron schedule (for scheduled jobs) is correctly configured. Use an online cron expression validator if needed.
     2. **Polling SCM**: Ensure that SCM polling is enabled, and the polling frequency is set properly.
     3. **Logs**: Check the Jenkins system log for errors related to build triggers or SCM polling.
     4. **Plugin update**: Ensure that plugins responsible for SCM integration (e.g., Git plugin) are up to date.

---
