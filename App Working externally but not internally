If an application hosted on AWS EC2 is accessible externally but not internally (e.g., from within the same VPC or from other EC2 instances), there are several possible issues to investigate:

1. Security Group Configuration
   - Outbound Rules: Check the outbound rules of the EC2 instance's security group to ensure that it allows traffic to internal resources, such as other instances in the same VPC or subnets.
   - Inbound Rules: Verify the inbound rules of the security group. You need to ensure that the security group allows incoming traffic on the port used by the application (e.g., HTTP on port 80, HTTPS on port 443, etc.) from other EC2 instances within the same VPC. For internal traffic, ensure that traffic from the VPC CIDR range is allowed.
   - Self-referencing Security Group Rule: If instances are trying to communicate with each other within the same security group, ensure that there’s a self-referencing rule allowing inbound traffic from instances using the same security group.

   Example Security Group Configuration:
   
   Inbound Rule:
   Type     | Protocol | Port Range | Source
   ---------|----------|------------|--------
   HTTP     | TCP      | 80         | 0.0.0.0/0 (for external traffic)
   HTTP     | TCP      | 80         | 10.0.0.0/16 (for internal traffic, replace with VPC CIDR)
   
   Outbound Rule:
   Type     | Protocol | Port Range | Destination
   ---------|----------|------------|------------
   All traffic | All   | All        | 0.0.0.0/0 (or restrict to internal traffic destination)
   

2. Network ACL (NACL) Configuration
   - Subnet NACL: Ensure that the Network ACL associated with the subnets where the EC2 instances are located allows internal traffic. NACLs are stateless, so you need to ensure both inbound and outbound rules allow the traffic.
   - NACLs should allow traffic on the port used by your application (e.g., port 80 for HTTP) and should not block traffic between instances within the same VPC.

   Example NACL Configuration:
   
   Inbound Rule:
   Rule #  | Type   | Protocol | Port Range | Source
   --------|--------|----------|------------|--------
   100     | HTTP   | TCP      | 80         | 10.0.0.0/16 (for internal traffic)
   
   Outbound Rule:
   Rule #  | Type   | Protocol | Port Range | Destination
   --------|--------|----------|------------|------------
   100     | HTTP   | TCP      | 80         | 10.0.0.0/16 (for internal traffic)
   

3. Internal DNS or IP Resolution
   - DNS Resolution: If the application uses DNS for internal communication, ensure that DNS resolution is working correctly. Instances in the same VPC should be able to resolve each other using their private DNS names.
   - Private IP Usage: Ensure that other instances trying to access the application are using the private IP address or private DNS name of the EC2 instance rather than the public IP or public DNS. Using the public IP might route traffic through the internet gateway, causing latency or failures if internal communication is restricted.

4. VPC Peering (if Cross-VPC Communication)
   - If instances in different VPCs need to communicate, ensure that a VPC peering connection exists and the route tables are properly configured to allow traffic between the VPCs. Also, check security groups and NACLs to ensure they allow traffic between the peered VPCs.

5. EC2 Instance Configuration
   - Firewall on the Instance: Ensure that the EC2 instance itself doesn't have a firewall (e.g., `iptables` in Linux or Windows Firewall) that blocks internal traffic while allowing external traffic.
   - Application-Level Configuration: Check if the application itself is configured to bind only to the public IP and not the private IP, which can prevent internal instances from accessing the service. Ensure the application is listening on all network interfaces (e.g., 0.0.0.0) rather than just the public IP.

   Linux Example: If an application binds to `0.0.0.0`, it listens on all interfaces (both private and public). If it binds to a specific IP (e.g., public IP), it won’t accept traffic from internal sources.

6. Route Table Issues
   - Route Tables for Subnets: Check the route tables associated with the subnets in which your EC2 instances are located. Ensure there’s a route for internal traffic within the VPC and that traffic is not inadvertently routed to an internet gateway or NAT gateway when it should remain within the VPC.

   Example Route Table:
   
   Destination       Target
   10.0.0.0/16       local (this ensures internal VPC communication)
   0.0.0.0/0         igw-xxxxxxxx (only for external traffic)
   

7. NAT Gateway Misconfiguration
   - If your instances are in a private subnet and trying to reach the application using public IPs, ensure that NAT Gateway is configured properly. However, internal traffic should typically route using private IPs without going through a NAT gateway or internet gateway.

8. Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB) Misconfiguration (If Used)
   - If the application is behind a load balancer (ALB, NLB), ensure that the load balancer’s security groups allow traffic from internal sources. Also, check if the internal traffic is routed to the load balancer properly, and ensure the target group includes the correct instances and health checks are passing.

9. Internal Application-Level Firewall
   - Some applications have built-in access control mechanisms (e.g., IP whitelisting). If your application has internal access control features, verify that internal IP ranges are allowed.

Steps to Troubleshoot:
1. Security Groups: Check both the security group of the EC2 instance and the security groups of the instances trying to access it.
2. NACLs: Verify that the subnet's Network ACLs are allowing internal traffic.
3. Check the Application Configuration: Make sure the application is bound to the right IP and allows internal traffic.
4. Ping/Traceroute: Test internal connectivity between instances using `ping` or `traceroute` to ensure traffic reaches the EC2 instance.
5. Firewall Settings: Ensure the instance-level firewall (e.g., `iptables` or Windows Firewall) is not blocking internal traffic.
6. DNS/Private IP: Confirm that internal instances are using the private IP or private DNS name for the application, not the public IP.
